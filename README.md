Project Overview
This project performs data analytics on Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data to uncover insights about player performances, team statistics, match outcomes, and venue influences. The analysis leverages Python for data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, SQL for complex querying and aggregation, and Power BI for interactive visualization and dashboard creation.

Project Workflow
1. Python Data Processing
Load raw data files (deliveries.csv, matches.csv).

Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values and formatting columns.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) including key statistics and feature engineering (strike rate, economy rate).

Export the cleaned and aggregated dataset to CSV or directly load into a SQL database.

2. SQL Data Analysis
Import processed datasets into a SQL database.

Write queries to extract analytical insights such as team performance across seasons and venues, player consistency, and toss impact on match outcomes.

Save query outputs for use in Power BI visualization.

3. Power BI Dashboard
Import data outputs from SQL queries or cleaned CSV files.

Build dynamic dashboards with visuals for top batsmen, bowlers, team win/loss patterns, and match statistics.

Incorporate filters, slicers, and drill-down features for detailed user exploration.

Present insights visually to aid cricket analytics.

Requirements
Python 3.8+ with libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite)

Power BI Desktop

How to Run
Execute data_cleaning.py and exploratory_analysis.py in Python to preprocess and analyze the data.

Use export_to_sql.py to load the prepared data into your SQL database.

Run SQL scripts in the sql folder to generate analytical tables and reports.

Open IPL_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop, connect to the data source, and explore the interactive visuals.

Use slicers and filters in Power BI to drill down into specific seasons, teams, players, and venues.
